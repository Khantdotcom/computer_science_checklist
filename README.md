# Computer Science and Engineering Roadmap and Checklist

> This is the complete syllabus of [Computer Science and Engineering UG](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/CST/node1.html).

~~I will add links to learning material as soon as possible.~~

> Do not get overwhelmed by the long list. This is the roadmap for 4 years of degree course.

_You could finish this all in just 1 year with continuity_

~~If you have any suggestions , you can message me on twitter @apemanoffcial~~
