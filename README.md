## Prerequisite Knowledge

- [ ] **Learn C**
    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying.
    - [ ] [C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.
