# Awesome_CSE

An awesome list for Computer Science and Engineering roadmap. Beginner, intermediate and advanced. 
_Your inputs are welcomed. This list is in Public Domain._
~~For Specific Rodmaps, browse my repositories.~~

> This is the whole syllabus of Computer science for an under-graduate course of duration 4 years.
> If you think a topic belongs to some other category, you can raise an issue and we can discuss.

## Even though this list is huge, 
> Pull requests are welcomed. I might edit them for brewity.

**There Are 5 paths you can start your journey with :**

* Mathematics
* Computer Science
* Machine Learning
* Computer Graphics
* Web and UI / UX

# Mathematics

Mathematics is divided in two parts :

Part I : Used in General.

Part II : Used in Graphics and Machine learning.

## Part I : 

**Matrices and Determinants**

**Binomial Equations**

**Permutations and Combinations**

**Sequence and Series**

**Sets and Venn Diagrams**

**Reasoning and Logic**

**Probability**

**Statistics**

## Part II : 

**Complex Numbers and Quadratic, Cubic Equations**

**Trigonometric Functions**

**Coordinate Geometry 2D-3D**

**Calculus and Differential Equations**

**Limits and Continuity**

&#x200B;

# Machine Learning : 

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Neural Networks

## Data Science : 

## Deep Learning : 

### Natural Language Processing

### Computer Vision

### Generative Neural Networks

&#x200B;

# Graphics : 

**Ray\_casting**

**Ray\_tracing**

**Rendering 2D**

### Image formats

### Image Processing

### Animation

### Visualization

### Rendering 3D

### Augmented Reality

### Videos

&#x200B;

# Computer Science : 

### Hardware

### Digital Electronics

### Computer Organization and Architecture

### Assembly Language

### Computation and Grammers

### Compiler Design

### Programming

***C*** Compiled - Curly Braces {} - Procedural

***C++*** Compiled {} - Object oriented (OO)

***Ruby*** Interpreted - {} based - OO

***Python*** Interpreted - Indentation based - OO

***Nim*** Compiled - Indentation Based - Procedural

### Data Structures

**Linked Lists** Singly, Doubly, Circular.

**Skip Lists** and **Hash Tables**

**stack** and **queues**

**Trees** and **Tries**

**Graphs** and **Multidimentional Graphs**

### Algorithms

### Files and Databases

### Operating Systems

#### Scheduling

### Security and Malwares

### Cryptography

### Virtual Machines and Hypervisors

### Cloud Computing

### Computer Networks

### Compression

### HTTPS and Protocols

&#x200B;

# Web and UI / UX: 

### HTML5 

### CSS3

**positioning**

**Flexbox**

**Grid**

**media queries**

**keyframes**

### JavaScript

**DOM Handling**

### UI Design

### Acessibility

### Color Theory

&#x200B;

# Misc:

### Git or SVN

Because versioning saves from loosing all your work.

### GitHub or GitLab or BitBucket

Because You need to let people know what you have coded.

&#x200B;

# Advices: 

## Text Editors

**Use Text Editors instead of IDEs**

### Suggested Editors

**Notepad** (For Python and nim) Built-in

**Scite** (Perfect for beginners) 3MB

**Brackets** (For web Dev) 70MB LightWeight

**Atom / VS Code** (If you have RAM > 4GB) MiddleWeight

### Suggested IDEs

**Codeblocks / Codelite**(C++ / C / D) MiddleWeight

## communities

**Dribbble**(Useful only on subscription)

**Behance**(Good but uses too much internet)

## Things to avoid

Visual Studio (you will never use it unless you are insane) HUMONGOUS

Windows 10 (Bandwidth hog)

Fanboying or Fangirling



## What's wrong with Software industry

**Hiring** It's broken (will add links later)

**Meetings** Stupid scrum standups
