# Computer Science and Engineering Roadmap and Checklist

> This is the complete syllabus of [Computer Science and Engineering UG](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/CST/node1.html).

> Do not get overwhelmed by the long list. This is the roadmap for 4 years of degree course.

_You could finish this all in just 1 year with continuity_

#### Computer Science is divided in 4 parts
 - [Computer Science 1](#computer-science---1) : Covers the Hardware and Engineering part.
 - [Computer Science 2](#computer-science---2) : Covers everything that is required to write Programs.
 - [Computer Science 3](#computer-science---3) : Covers the Trinity of Computer Science.
 - [Computer Science 4](#computer-science---4) : Covers the Real Life Applications of CS.


[**Discrete Mathematics**](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~arlal/book/mth202.pdf) is necessary for understanding Graphs.

**Mathematics is not mandatory but will be of good help while programming**
 - [Mathematics Syllabus can be found here](https://github.com/apeman/awesome_computer_science/blob/master/Mathematics.md)
 - It includes everything from High school to Secondary Level.
