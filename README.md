**There Are 5 paths you can start your journey with :**

* Mathematics
* Computer Science
* Machine Learning
* Computer Graphics
* Web and UI / UX

# Mathematics

Mathematics is divided in two parts :

Part I : Used in General.

Part II : Used in Graphics and Machine learning.

## Part I : 

**Matrices and Determinants** : Used exessively in Programming

**Binomial Equations** : To calculate permutations and Combinations

**Permutations and Combinations** : For finding probability and sum of series

**Sequence and Series** : To find patterns

**Sets and Venn Diagrams** : To categorize \_ used a lot in Decision trees and Friends

**Reasoning and Logic** : AI and Game dev.

**Probability** : Data Science and Machine Learning

**Statistics** : Data Science

## Part II : 

**Complex Numbers and Quadratic, Cubic Equations** : Almost everywhere

**Trigonometric Functions** : Mostly Graphics and Physics engines 

**Coordinate Geometry 2D-3D** : Graphics and Physics engines

**Calculus and Differential Equations** : Graphics and Data Science and Deep Learning

**Limits and Continuity** : see calculus

**Rendering 2D**

### Image formats
PNG
BMP
JPG
TIFF
GIF

### Image Processing

See OpenCV

### Visualization

### Rendering 3D

### Augmented Reality

### Animation

Frames

### Videos

&#x200B;

# Computer Science : 

### Hardware

### Digital Electronics

### Computer Organization and Architecture

### Assembly Language

### Computation and Grammers

### Compiler Design

### Programming

***C*** - Compiled - Curly Braces {} - Procedural

***C++*** - Compiled {} - Object oriented (OO)

***Ruby*** - Interpreted - {} based - OO

***Python*** - Interpreted - Indentation based - OO

***Nim*** - Compiled - Indentation Based - Procedural

### Data Structures

**Linked Lists** Singly, Doubly, Circular.

**Skip Lists** and **Hash Tables**

**stack** and **queues**

**Trees** and **Tries**

**Graphs** and **Multidimentional Graphs**

### Algorithms

### Files and Databases

### Operating Systems

#### Scheduling

### Security and Malwares

### Cryptography

### Virtual Machines and Hypervisors

### Cloud Computing

### Computer Networks

### Compression

### HTTPS and Protocols

&#x200B;

# Web and UI / UX: 

### HTML5 

### CSS3

**positioning**

**Flexbox**

**Grid**

**media queries**

**keyframes**

### JavaScript

**DOM Handling**

### UI Design

### Acessibility

### Color Theory

&#x200B;

# Misc:

### Git or SVN

Because versioning saves from loosing all your work.

### GitHub or GitLab or BitBucket

Because You need to let people know what you have coded.

&#x200B;

# Advices: 

## Text Editors

**Use Text Editors instead of IDEs**

### Suggested Editors

**Notepad** (For Python and nim) Built-in

**Scite** (Perfect for beginners) 3MB

**Brackets** (For web Dev) 70MB LightWeight

**Atom / VS Code** (If you have RAM > 4GB) MiddleWeight

### Suggested IDEs

**Codeblocks / Codelite** (C++ / C / D) MiddleWeight

## communities

**Dribbble** (Useful only on subscription)

**Behance** (Good but uses too much internet)

## Things to avoid

Visual Studio (you will never use it unless you are insane) HUMONGOUS

Windows 10 (Bandwidth hog)

Fanboying or Fangirling



## What's wrong with Software industry

**Hiring** It's broken (will add links later)

**Meetings** Stupid scrum standups
